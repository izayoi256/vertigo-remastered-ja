log_fred,"Finally got the shipment of janitorial drones from assembly, which means I’m out of a job. Couldn’t be happier, to be honest. Get to head up to the surface a few days early. It’s about time too, the [quot]matter exchange events[quot] (read: an ugly-ass alien pops into our dimension and I have to mop it up once it’s killed) have been getting more and more frequent, once every few weeks now. In our sector, at least. I can’t imagine what it’ll be like after the reactor fully starts up. Glad I’m getting out of here early.

Only thing I’ll miss is Brian. One of the local scientists. He’s a senile idiot that should not have access to Planck’s technology, but he’s a fun guy. Wonder what he’ll be up to after evac, might try to get a beer with him topside some day.

Anyway, better finish packing up. I’m ready to see the sun again after these long years."
